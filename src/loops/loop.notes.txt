Loops: Repetitive Work

Types:
    1. for loop
    2. while loop
    3. do-while loop


1. For Loop

    for(initialization; condition; update_expression) {
        //body of the loop.
    }

    It is an entry-controlled loop;

    For example:
    for(int i = 3; i<2; i++) {
        System.out.println("I am inside loop");
    }

    This won't print anything because 3 is not less than 2, and therefore the condition evaluated
    to be false.
    This is why for loops are called entry controlled loops because condition is checked first.


2. while loop

    Syntax:
    while(expression) {
        //body of the loop
    }

    For example:
    int i = 1;
    while(i<=5) {
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
    }

    While loop is also an entry controlled loop.
