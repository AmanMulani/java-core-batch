List (Abstract DataType)
A list is a collection of elements whose size is dynamic, unlike array. Therefore more flexible that arrays.

List<DataType> list = new ArrayList<>();

Add: list.add(elem) //Adds to the end of the list.
Update: list.add(index, elem); //Adds to the required index.
Delete: list.remove(index); //Deletes the element at the given index.
Read: list.get(index); //Gets the element at the given index.

You cannot use primitive data types(int, float, double, boolean, char) with collections.
Instead use: Integer, Boolean, Double, Float, Character.

MAP
What is a Map?
It is a simple key-value pair.
Example: Consider a dictionary. A dictionary has words, and each word has some meaning.
So we can think of the word as a key and meaning as value.

{
    key: value.
}


SET
Set is an unordered collection of data.

Set<DataType> variableName = new HashSet<>();

Ex: Set<String> names = new Set<>();

{"Aman", "Mulani", "John", "Jacobs"}
