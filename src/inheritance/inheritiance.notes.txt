What is inheritance?
It is a concept by which the child class inherits or gets some pre-defined behavior and characteristics
from the parent class.

Example:

Create objects of different types of animals. (minimum 5)

1. Dog 
    class Dog {
        int legs = 4;
        int eyes = 2;

        public void breathe() {
            System.out.println("I breathe");
        }
    }

2. Cat
    class Cat {
        int legs = 4;
        int eyes = 2;

        public void breathe() {
            System.out.println("I breathe");
        }
    }


3. Elephant 
    class Elephant {
        int legs = 4;
        int eyes = 2;

        public void breathe() {
            System.out.println("I breathe");
        }
    }


4. Horse
    class Horse {
        int legs = 4;
        int eyes = 2;

        public void breathe() {
            System.out.println("I breathe");
        }
    }

Imagine that there is an Animal class. This class has some properties and behavior which is common to all
animals such as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, tigers, etc.

//Super class / Parent Class
class Animal {
    int legs = 4;
    int eyes = 2;

    public void breathe() {
        System.out.println("I breathe");
    }
}

How to extend classes (Inheritance):

//This is the child class / derived class
class Dog extends Animal {

}
